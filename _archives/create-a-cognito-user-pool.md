description: Amazon Cognito User Pool handles sign-up and sign-in functionality for web and mobile apps. We are going to create a Cognito User Pool to store and manage the users for our serverless app. We'll use the email address as username option since we want our users to login with their email. We are also going to set up our app as an App Client for our Cognito User Pool.

Our notes app needs to handle user accounts and authentication in a secure and reliable way. To do this we are going to use [Amazon Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/).

Amazon Cognito User Pool makes it easy for developers to add sign-up and sign-in functionality to web and mobile applications. It serves as your own identity provider to maintain a user directory. It supports user registration and sign-in, as well as provisioning identity tokens for signed-in users.

In this chapter, we are going to create a User Pool for our notes app.

### Create User Pool

From your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com), select **Cognito** from the list of services.

Select **Manage your User Pools**.

Select **Create a User Pool**.

Enter **Pool name** and select **Review defaults**.

Select **Choose username attributes...**.

And select **Email address or phone numbers** and **Allow email addresses**. This is telling Cognito User Pool that we want our users to be able to sign up and login with their email as their username.

Scroll down and select **Next step**.

Hit **Review** in the side panel and make sure that the **Username attributes** is set to **email**.

Now hit **Create pool** at the bottom of the page.

Your User Pool has been created. Take a note of the **Pool Id** and **Pool ARN** which will be required later. Also, note the region that your User Pool is created in – in our case it's `us-east-1`.

### Create App Client

Select **App clients** from the left panel.

Select **Add an app client**.

![Select Add An App Screenshot](/assets/cognito-user-pool/select-add-an-app.png)

Enter **App client name**, un-select **Generate client secret**, select **Enable sign-in API for server-based authentication**, then select **Create app client**.

- **DISABLE client secret generation**: user pool apps with a client secret are not supported by the JavaScript SDK. We need to un-select the option.
- **Enable username password auth for admin APIs for authentication**: required by AWS CLI when managing the pool users via command line interface. We will be creating a test user through the command line interface in the next chapter.

Now select **Create app client**.

Your app client has been created. Take note of the **App client id** which will be required in the later chapters.

### Create Domain Name

Finally, select **Domain name** from the left panel. Enter your unique domain name and select **Save changes**. In our case we are using `notes-app`.

Now our Cognito User Pool is ready. It will maintain a user directory for our notes app. It will also be used to authenticate access to our API. Next let's set up a test user within the pool.
