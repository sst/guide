Now that we have our domain and a certificate to serve it over HTTPS, let's associate these with our CloudFront Distribution

### Add Alternate Domain for CloudFront Distribution

Head over to the details of your CloudFront Distribution and hit **Edit**.

And type in your new domain name in the **Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)** field.

Now switch the **SSL Certificate** to **Custom SSL Certificate** and select the certificate we just created from the drop down. And scroll down to the bottom and hit **Yes, Edit**.

Scroll down and hit **Yes, Edit** to save the changes.

Next, head over to the **Behaviors** tab from the top.

And select the only one we have and hit **Edit**.

Then switch the **Viewer Protocol Policy** to **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS**. And scroll down to the bottom and hit **Yes, Edit**.

Next, let's point our domain to the CloudFront Distribution.

### Point Domain to CloudFront Distribution

Head back into Route 53 and hit the **Hosted Zones** button. If you don't have an existing **Hosted Zone**, you'll need to create one by adding the **Domain Name** and selecting **Public Hosted Zone** as the **Type**.

Select your domain from the list and hit **Create Record Set** in the details screen.

Leave the **Name** field empty since we are going to point our bare domain (without the www.) to our CloudFront Distribution.

And select **Alias** as **Yes** since we are going to simply point this to our CloudFront domain.

In the **Alias Target** dropdown, select your CloudFront Distribution.

Finally, hit **Create** to add your new record set.

### Add IPv6 Support

CloudFront Distributions have IPv6 enabled by default and this means that we need to create an AAAA record as well. It is set up exactly the same way as the Alias record.

Create a new Record Set with the exact settings as before, except make sure to pick **AAAA - IPv6 address** as the **Type**.

And hit **Create** to add your AAAA record set.

It can take around an hour to update the DNS records but once it's done, you should be able to access your app through your domain.

Next up, we'll take a quick look at ensuring that our www. domain also directs to our app.
