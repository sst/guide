description: Amazon Cognito Federated Identities helps us secure our AWS resources. We can use the Cognito User Pool as an identity provider for our serverless backend. To allow users to be able to upload files to our S3 bucket and connect to API Gateway we need to create an Identity Pool. We will assign it an IAM Policy with the name of our S3 bucket and prefix our files with the cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub. And weâ€™ll add our API Gateway endpoint as a resource as well.

Now that we have deployed our backend API; we almost have all the pieces we need for our backend. We have the User Pool that is going to store all of our users and help sign in and sign them up. We also have an S3 bucket that we will use to help our users upload files as attachments for their notes. The final piece that ties all these services together in a secure way is called Amazon Cognito Federated Identities.

Amazon Cognito Federated Identities enables developers to create unique identities for your users and authenticate them with federated identity providers. With a federated identity, you can obtain temporary, limited-privilege AWS credentials to securely access other AWS services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and Amazon API Gateway.

In this chapter, we are going to create a federated Cognito Identity Pool. We will be using our User Pool as the identity provider. We could also use Facebook, Google, or our own custom identity provider. Once a user is authenticated via our User Pool, the Identity Pool will attach an IAM Role to the user. We will define a policy for this IAM Role to grant access to the S3 bucket and our API. This is the Amazon way of securing your resources.

Let's get started.

### Create Pool

From your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and select **Cognito** from the list of services.

Select **Manage Federated Identities**.

Enter an **Identity pool name**. If you have any existing Identity Pools, you'll need to click the **Create new identity pool** button.

Select **Authentication providers**. Under **Cognito** tab, enter **User Pool ID** and **App Client ID** of the User Pool created in the [Create a Cognito user pool]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-user-pool.md %}) chapter. Select **Create Pool**.

Now we need to specify what AWS resources are accessible for users with temporary credentials obtained from the Cognito Identity Pool.

Select **View Details**. Two **Role Summary** sections are expanded. The top section summarizes the permission policy for authenticated users, and the bottom section summarizes that for unauthenticated users.

Select **View Policy Document** in the top section. Then select **Edit**.

It will warn you to read the documentation. Select **Ok** to edit.

{%change%} Add the following policy into the editor. Replace `YOUR_S3_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME` with the **bucket name** from the [Create an S3 bucket for file uploads]({% link _chapters/create-an-s3-bucket-for-file-uploads.md %}) chapter. And replace the `YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION` and `YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ID` with the ones that you got back in the [Deploy the APIs]({% link _chapters/deploy-the-apis.md %}) chapter.

In our case `YOUR_S3_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME` is `notes-app-uploads`, `YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ID` is `ly55wbovq4`, and `YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION` is `us-east-1`.

``` json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "mobileanalytics:PutEvents",
        "cognito-sync:*",
        "cognito-identity:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:*"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::YOUR_S3_UPLOADS_BUCKET_NAME/private/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "execute-api:Invoke"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:execute-api:YOUR_API_GATEWAY_REGION:*:YOUR_API_GATEWAY_ID/*/*/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Once a user has been authenticated with our User Pool and verified with our Identity Pool, he/she is assigned this [IAM role]({% link _chapters/what-is-iam.md %}). This role limits what our user has access to in our AWS account.

A quick note on the block that relates to the S3 Bucket. In the above policy we are granting our logged in users access to the path `private/${cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub}/`. Where `cognito-identity.amazonaws.com:sub` is the authenticated user's federated identity ID (their user id). So a user has access to only their folder within the bucket. This is how we are securing the uploads for each user.

So in summary we are telling AWS that an authenticated user has access to two resources.

1. Files in the S3 bucket that are inside a folder with their federated identity id as the name of the folder.
2. And, the APIs we deployed using API Gateway.

One other thing to note is that the federated identity id is a UUID that is assigned by our Identity Pool. This id is different from the one that a user is assigned in a User Pool. This is because you can have multiple authentication providers. The Identity Pool _federates_ these identities and gives each user a unique id.

Next, select **Allow**.

Our Cognito Identity Pool should now be created. Let's find out the Identity Pool ID.

Select **Dashboard** from the left panel, then select **Edit identity pool**.

Take a note of the **Identity pool ID** which will be required in the later chapters.

Now we are ready to use what we've created so far to secure access to our APIs.
