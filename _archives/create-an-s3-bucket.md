To be able to host our note taking app, we need to upload the assets that are going to be served out statically on S3. S3 has a concept of buckets (or folders) to separate different types of files.

A bucket can also be configured to host the assets in it as a static website and is automatically assigned a publicly accessible URL. So let's get started.

### Create the Bucket

First, log in to your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) and select S3 from the list of services.

Select **Create Bucket** and pick a name for your application and select the **US East (N. Virginia) Region** Region. Since our application is being served out using a CDN, the region should not matter to us.

Click **Next** through the configure options step.

In the permissions step, make sure to uncheck **Block new public bucket policies** and **Block public and cross-account access if bucket has public policies**. Making buckets public is a common security error, but in our case we'll be serving our app from the bucket, so want it to be public.

Click **Create bucket** on the review page to create the bucket.

Now click on your newly created bucket from the list and navigate to its permissions panel by clicking **Permissions**.

### Add Permissions

Buckets by default are not publicly accessible, so we need to change the S3 Bucket Permission. Select the **Bucket Policy** from the permissions panel.

{%change%} Add the following bucket policy into the editor. Where `notes-app-client` is the name of our S3 bucket. Make sure to use the name of your bucket here.

```json
{
  "Version":"2012-10-17",
  "Statement":[{
	"Sid":"PublicReadForGetBucketObjects",
        "Effect":"Allow",
	  "Principal": "*",
      "Action":["s3:GetObject"],
      "Resource":["arn:aws:s3:::notes-app-client/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

And hit **Save**.

### Enable Static Web Hosting

And finally we need to turn our bucket into a static website. Select the **Properties** tab from the top panel.

Select **Static website hosting**.

Now select **Use this bucket to host a website** and add our `index.html` as the **Index Document** and the **Error Document**. Since we are letting React handle 404s, we can simply redirect our errors to our `index.html` as well. Hit **Save** once you are done.

This panel also shows us where our app will be accessible. AWS assigns us a URL for our static website. In this case the URL assigned to me is `notes-app-client.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

Now that our bucket is all set up and ready, let's go ahead and upload our assets to it.
