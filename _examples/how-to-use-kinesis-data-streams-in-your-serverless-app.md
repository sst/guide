In this example we will look at how to create a Kinesis Data Stream in our serverless app using [Serverless Stack (SST)]({{ site.sst_github_repo }}).

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 10.15.1
- We'll be using Node.js (or ES) in this example but you can also use TypeScript
- An [AWS account]({% link _chapters/create-an-aws-account.md %}) with the [AWS CLI configured locally]({% link _chapters/configure-the-aws-cli.md %})

## Create an SST app

{%change%} Let's start by creating an SST app.

```bash
$ npx create-serverless-stack@latest kinesisstream
$ cd kinesisstream
```

By default our app will be deployed to an environment (or stage) called `dev` and the `us-east-1` AWS region. This can be changed in the `sst.json` in your project root.

```json
{
  "name": "kinesisstream",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "main": "stacks/index.js"
}
```

## Project layout

An SST app is made up of two parts.

1. `stacks/` — App Infrastructure

   The code that describes the infrastructure of your serverless app is placed in the `stacks/` directory of your project. SST uses [AWS CDK]({% link _chapters/what-is-aws-cdk.md %}), to create the infrastructure.

2. `src/` — App Code

   The code that's run when your API is invoked is placed in the `src/` directory of your project.

## Adding a Kinesis Data Stream

[Amazon Kinesis Data Streams](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/data-streams/) is a serverless streaming data service that makes it easy to capture, process, and store data streams at any scale. And you won't get charged if you are not using it.

{%change%} Replace the `stacks/MyStack.js` with the following.

```js
import * as sst from "@serverless-stack/resources";

export default class MyStack extends sst.Stack {
  constructor(scope, id, props) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    // create a kinesis stream
    const stream = new sst.KinesisStream(this, "Stream", {
      consumers: {
        consumer1: "src/consumer1.handler",
        consumer2: "src/consumer2.handler",
      },
    });
  }
}
```

This creates an Kinesis Data Stream using [`sst.KinesisStream`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/KinesisStream) and it has a consumer that polls for messages from the Kinesis Data Stream. The consumer function will run when it has polled 1 or more messages.

## Setting up the API

Now let's add the API.

{%change%} Add this below the `sst.KinesisStream` definition in `stacks/MyStack.js`.

```js
// Create a HTTP API
const api = new sst.Api(this, "Api", {
  defaultFunctionProps: {
    environment: {
      streamName: stream.streamName,
    },
  },
  routes: {
    "POST /": "src/lambda.handler",
  },
});

api.attachPermissions([stream]);

// Show the endpoint in the output
this.addOutputs({
  ApiEndpoint: api.url,
});
```

Our [API]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/api) simply has one endpoint (the root). When we make a `POST` request to this endpoint the Lambda function called `handler` in `src/lambda.js` will get invoked.

We also pass in the stream name to our API as an environment variable called `streamName`. And we allow our API to send messages to the Kinesis Data Stream we just created.

## Adding function code

We will create three functions, one for handling the API request, and the other two for the consumers.

{%change%} Replace the `src/lambda.js` with the following.

```js
export async function handler() {
  console.log("Message queued!");
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: "successful" }),
  };
}
```

{%change%} Add a `src/consumer1.js`.

```js
export async function handler() {
  console.log("Message 1 processed!");
  return {};
}
```

{%change%} Add a `src/consumer2.js`.

```js
export async function handler() {
  console.log("Message 2 processed!");
  return {};
}
```

Now let's test our new API.

## Starting your dev environment

{%change%} SST features a [Live Lambda Development]({{ site.docs_url }}/live-lambda-development) environment that allows you to work on your serverless apps live.

```bash
$ npx sst start
```

The first time you run this command it'll take a couple of minutes to deploy your app and a debug stack to power the Live Lambda Development environment.

 ✅  dev-kinesisstream-my-stack


Stack dev-kinesisstream-my-stack
  Status: deployed
  Outputs:
    ApiEndpoint: https://i8ia1epqnh.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

The `ApiEndpoint` is the API we just created.

Let's test our endpoint with the [SST Console](https://console.serverless-stack.com). The SST Console is a web based dashboard to manage your SST apps. [Learn more about it in our docs]({{ site.docs_url }}/console).

Go to the **Functions** tab and click the **Invoke** button of the `POST /` function to send a `POST` request.

![Functions tab invoke button](/assets/examples/kinesisstream/functions_tab_invoke_button.png)

After you see a success status in the logs, go to the **Local** tab in the console to see all function invocations. Local tab displays **real-time logs** from your Live Lambda Dev environment.

![Local tab response without kinesis](/assets/examples/kinesisstream/Local_tab_response_without_kinesis.png)

You should see `Message queued!` logged in the console.

## Sending messages to our Kinesis Data Stream

Now let's send a message to our Kinesis Data Stream.

{%change%} Replace the `src/lambda.js` with the following.

```js
import AWS from "aws-sdk";

const stream = new AWS.Kinesis();

export async function handler() {
  await stream
    .putRecord({
      Data: JSON.stringify({
        message: "Hello from Lambda!",
      }),
      PartitionKey: "key",
      StreamName: process.env.streamName,
    })
    .promise();

  console.log("Message queued!");
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ status: "successful" }),
  };
}
```

Here we are getting the Kinesis Data Stream name from the environment variable, and then sending a message to it.

{%change%} Let's install the `aws-sdk` in the root.

```bash
$ npm install aws-sdk
```

And now if you head over to your console and invoke the function again. You'll notice in the **Local** tab that our consumers are called. You should see `Message 1 processed!` and `Message 2 processed!` being printed out.

## Deploying to prod

{%change%} To wrap things up we'll deploy our app to prod.

```bash
$ npx sst deploy --stage prod
```

This allows us to separate our environments, so when we are working in dev, it doesn't break the API for our users.

## Cleaning up

Finally, you can remove the resources created in this example using the following commands.

```bash
$ npx sst remove
$ npx sst remove --stage prod
```

## Conclusion

And that's it! We've got a completely serverless Kinesis Data Stream system. Check out the repo below for the code we used in this example. And leave a comment if you have any questions!
