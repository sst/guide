Repo for [**SST.dev**](https://sst.dev) and the [SST Guide](https://sst.dev/guide.html). If you are looking for the SST repo, [head over here](https://github.com/sst/sst).

## SST Guide

The guide is a comprehensive open source tutorial for building and deploying full-stack apps using Serverless and React on AWS.

We are going to create a [note taking app](https://demo.sst.dev) from scratch using React.js, AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and Cognito.

![Demo App](assets/completed-app-desktop.png)

It is a single-page React app powered by a serverless CRUD API. We also cover how add user authentication and handle file uploads.

### Project Goals

- Provide a free comprehensive resource
- Add more content to build on core concepts
- Keep the content accurate and up to date
- Help people resolve their issues

### Getting Help

- If you are running into issues with a specific chapter, join us on [Discord][discord] and post in `#help`.
- Open a [new issue](../../issues/new) if you've found a bug
- If you've found a typo, edit the chapter and submit a [pull request][pr].

#### Source for the Demo App

- [Demo Notes App](https://github.com/sst/demo-notes-app)

## Contributing

Thank you for your considering to contribute. [Read more about how you can contribute to SST][contributing].

### Running Locally

SST is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). [Follow these steps to install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

### Viewing Locally

To install, run the following in the root of the project.

```bash
$ bundle install
```

And to view locally.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

You can now view the guide locally by visiting `http://localhost:4000/`.

You can also turn on live reloading and incremental builds while editing.

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental --livereload
```

#### Generating the eBook

We use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to create the eBook. You can generate it locally by following these steps.

```bash
$ cd ~/Sites/sst.dev/etc/ebook
$ make start
```

This'll start a Docker instance. Inside the Docker run:

```bash
$ make pdf
$ make epub
```

The above are run automatically through [Github Actions](https://github.com/sst/sst.dev/actions) in this repo:

- When a new commit is pushed to master
- And when a new tag is pushed, the generated eBook is uploaded to S3
