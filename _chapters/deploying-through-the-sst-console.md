Now, we are ready to _git push_ to deploy our app to production with the SST Console. If you recall from the [previous chapter]({% link _chapters/setting-up-the-sst-console.md %}), we confgiured it to auto-deploy the `production` branch. 

Let's do that by first creating a production branch.

{%change%} Run the following in the **project root**.

```bash
$ git checkout -b production
```

Now let's push this to GitHub.

```bash
$ git push --set-upstream origin production
$ git push
```

Now if you head into the **Autodeploy** tab for your app in the SST Console, you'll notice a new deployment in progress.

Once the deploy is complete, you'll notice the stack outputs at the bottom.

### Test Our App in Production

Let's check out our app in production.

To give it a quick test, sign up for a new account and create a note. You can also test updating and removing a note. And also test out the billing page.

**Congrats! Your app is now live!**

Let's wrap things up next.
