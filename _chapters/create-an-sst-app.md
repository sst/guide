Now that we understand what _infrastructure as code_ is, we are ready to create our first SST app.

{%change%} Run the following in your working directory.

```bash
$ npm init sst javascript-starter notes
$ cd notes
$ npm install
```

By default, our app will be deployed to an environment (or stage) called `dev` in the `us-east-1` AWS region. This can be changed in the `sst.json` in your project root.

```json
{
  "name": "notes",
  "region": "us-east-1",
  "main": "stacks/index.js"
}
```

## Project layout

An SST app is made up of two parts.

1. `stacks/` — App Infrastructure

   The code that describes the infrastructure of your serverless app is placed in the `stacks/` directory of your project. SST uses [AWS CDK]({% link _chapters/what-is-aws-cdk.md %}), to create the infrastructure.

2. `backend/` — App Code

   The Lambda function code that's run when your API is invoked is placed in the `backend/` directory of your project.

Later on we'll be adding a `frontend/` directory for our frontend React app.

The starter project that's created is defining a simple _Hello World_ API. In the next chapter, we'll be deploying it and running it locally.
