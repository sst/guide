Now we are going to add an API that returns a list of all the notes a user has. This'll be very similar to the [previous chapter]({% link _chapters/add-an-api-to-get-a-note.md %}) where we were returning a single note.

### Add the Function

{%change%} Create a new file in `packages/functions/src/list.ts` with the following.

```typescript
import handler from "@notes/core/handler";
import { APIGatewayProxyEvent } from 'aws-lambda';
import { Table } from "sst/node/table";
import dynamoDb from "@notes/core/dynamodb";

export const main = handler(async () => {
    const params = {
        TableName: Table.Notes.tableName,
        // 'KeyConditionExpression' defines the condition for the query
        // - 'userId = :userId': only return items with matching 'userId'
        //   partition key
        KeyConditionExpression: "userId = :userId",
        // 'ExpressionAttributeValues' defines the value in the condition
        // - ':userId': defines 'userId' to be the id of the author
        ExpressionAttributeValues: {
            ":userId": "123",
        },
    };

    const result = await dynamoDb.query(params);

    // Return the matching list of items in response body
    return result.Items;
});
```

This is pretty much the same as our `get.ts` except we use a condition to only return the items that have the same `userId` as the one we are passing in. In our case, it's still hardcoded to `123`.

### Add the Route

Let's add the route for this new endpoint.

{%change%} Add the following above the `POST /notes` route in `stacks/ApiStack.ts`.

```typescript
"GET /notes": "packages/functions/src/list.main",
```

{%deploy%}

```bash
✓  Deployed:
   StorageStack
   ApiStack
   ApiEndpoint: https://5bv7x0iuga.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Test the API

Let's test the list all notes API. Head to the **API** tab of the [SST Console]({{ site.old_console_url }}).

{%change%} Select the `/notes` API and click **Send**.

You should see the notes being returned in the response.

Notice that we are getting an array of notes. Instead of a single note.

Next we are going to add an API to update a note.
