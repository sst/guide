[Here is a little more details on this]({{ site.github_repo }}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#keep-the-core-guide-updated).

- **Add an extra credit chapter**

  The core chapters are missing some extra details (for the sake of simplicity) that are necessary once you start customizing the Serverless Stack setup. Additionally, there are cases that we just don't handle in the core part of the guide. We are addressing these via *Extra Credit chapters*. If you have had a chance to extend Serverless Stack consider writing a chapter on it. [Here are further details on how to add an extra credit chapter]({{ site.github_repo }}/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#add-an-extra-credit-chapter).
