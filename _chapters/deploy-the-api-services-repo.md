Just as the previous chapter we'll add the API repo on Seed and deploy it to our environments.

Click **Add an App** again, and select your Git provider. This time, select the API repo.

![Select Add an App in Seed](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/select-add-an-app-in-seed.png)

Select the **notes-api** service from the list of services.

The environments for our API repo are identical to our resources repo. So instead of manually configuring them, we'll copy the settings.

Select **Copy Settings** tab, and select the resources app. Then hit **Add a New App**.

![Set app settings from resources](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/set-app-settings-from-resources.png)

The API app has been created. Now, let's add the other services. Head over to the **Pipeline** tab.

![Create an App in Seed](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/create-an-app-in-seed.png)

Click **Add a service** to add the **billing-api** service at the `services/billing-api` path. And then repeat the step to add the **notify-job** service at the `services/notify-job` path.

Next, click on **Manage Deploy Phases**.

Again you'll notice that by default all the services are deployed concurrently.

Since the **billing-api** service depends on the **notes-api** service, and in turn the **notify-job** service depends on the **billing-api** service, we are going too add 2 phases. And move the **billing-api** service to **Phase 2**, and the **notify-job** service to **Phase 3**. Finally, click **Update Phases**.

Now let's make our first deployment.

![Show services are deploying in dev stage](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/show-services-are-deploying-in-dev-stage.png)

You can see the deployments were carried out according to the specified deploy phases.

Just as before, promote **dev** to **prod**.

![Select Promote in dev stage](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/select-promote-in-dev-stage.png)

Hit **Promote to Production**.

![Promote dev stage to prod stage](/assets/best-practices/deploy-api-services-repo-to-seed/promote-dev-stage-to-prod-stage.png)

Now we have the API deployed to both **dev** and **prod**.

Now that our entire app has been deployed, let's look at how we are sharing environment specific configs across our services.
