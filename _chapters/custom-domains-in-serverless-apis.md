description: In this chapter we are setting a custom domain for our serverless API on AWS. We are using the SST Api construct to configure the custom domain.

In the [previous chapter]({% link _chapters/purchase-a-domain-with-route-53.md %}) we purchased a new domain on [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/){:target="_blank"}. Now let's use it for our serverless API.

{%change%} In your `stacks/ApiStack.ts` replace the function declaration with the following to add `app` from `StackContext`.

```typescript
export function ApiStack({ stack, app }: StackContext) {
```

{%change%} Then, add the following above the `defaults: {` line in `stacks/ApiStack.ts`.

```typescript
customDomain: app.stage === "prod" ? "<Your Domain>" : undefined,
```

This tells SST that we want to use a custom domain **if** we are deploying to the `prod` stage. We are not setting one for our `dev` stage, or any other stage.

We could for example, base it on the stage name, `api-${app.stage}.my-serverless-app.com`. So for `dev` it might be `api-dev.my-serverless-app.com`. But we'll leave that as an exercise for you.

We also need to update the outputs of our API stack.

{%change%} Finally, replace the `stack.addOutputs` call at the bottom of `stacks/ApiStack.ts`.

```typescript
stack.addOutputs({
  ApiEndpoint: api.customDomainUrl || api.url,
});
```

Here we are returning the custom domain URL, if we have one. If not, then we return the auto-generated URL.

### Deploy the App

Let's deploy these changes to prod.

{%change%} Run the following from **your project root**.

```bash
$ pnpm sst deploy --stage prod
```

{%note%}
Deploying changes to custom domains can take a few minutes.
{%endnote%}

At the end of the deploy process you should see something like this.

```bash
âœ“  Deployed:
   StorageStack
   ApiStack
   ApiEndpoint: https://api.my-serverless-app.com
   ...
```

This is great! We now have our app deployed to prod and our API has a custom domain.

Next, let's use our custom domain for our React app as well.
