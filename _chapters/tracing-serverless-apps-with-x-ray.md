title: Tracing serverless Apps with X-Ray
description: In this chapter we look at how to trace serverless apps using AWS X-Ray. Since your app is made up of multiple services, it's important to configure X-Ray to get visibility over a request as it flows through the system.

Typically as a serverless app grows, the number of AWS services involved also increases. This can make it tricky to debug them. [AWS X-Ray](https://aws.amazon.com/xray/) is a service that records and visualizes requests made by your application. It provides an end-to-end view of requests as they travel through your Serverless application, and shows a map of your application’s underlying components.

In this chapter we'll show you how to set up AWS X-Ray to trace API requests and Lambda invocations for your Serverless Framework application.

### Enable X-Ray tracing for API Gateway and Lambda

First let’s start by enabling X-Ray for your application.

Open your `serverless.yml` and add a `tracing` config inside the `provider` section:

``` yaml
provider:
  ...
  tracing:
    apiGateway: true
    lambda: true
```
Then add the IAM permissions required for Lambda to write to X-Ray under `iamRoleStatements` inside the `provider` section:

``` yaml
provider:
  ...
  iamRoleStatements:
    - Effect: Allow
      Action:
        ...
        - xray:PutTraceSegments
        - xray:PutTelemetryRecords
      Resource: "*"
```

Let’s use the following Lambda function as an example.

``` javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamodb = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
const sns = new AWS.SNS();

exports.main = async function(event) {
  await dynamodb.get({
    TableName: 'notes',
    Key: { noteId: 'note1' },
  }).promise();

  await sns.publish({
    Message           : 'test',
    TopicArn          : 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:113345762000:test-topic',
  }).promise();


  return { statusCode: 200, body: 'successful' };
}
```

Now run `serverless deploy` to deploy your service. Make sure to deploy your entire application (not just an individual function), since you made changes to your `serverless.yml`.

Note that, if you are trying to enable AWS X-Ray Tracing on existing serverless projects, make sure your Serverless CLI version is later than **1.44**.

After you deploy, invoke your API Gateway endpoint:

``` bash
$ curl https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xxx
```

Head over to your AWS X-Ray console, and select **Traces** from the left menu.

![Select Traces from AWS X-Ray console](/assets/best-practices/tracing-lambda-functions-with-x-ray/select-traces-from-the-aws-x-ray-console.png)

The **Trace overview** section at the top shows all the URLs that initiated the trace. And the **Trace list** section at the bottom shows each individual trace. By default, it shows all the traces within the last 5 minutes. However, you can pick a different time range.

Click on a trace in the **Trace list**. Note: it might take up to 30 seconds before a trace shows up after a request has been made.

![Select a trace in AWS X-Ray console](/assets/best-practices/tracing-lambda-functions-with-x-ray/click-on-a-trace-from-the-aws-x-ray-console.png)

Here are a couple of things you can see:

- The API request was a GET request and succeeded with a HTTP 200 status.
- The entire request took API Gateway 597ms to process.
- Out of 597ms, 594ms was spent by Lambda function. Meaning API Gateway added an overhead of 3ms to this request.
- And out of 594ms, it took 387ms for Lambda to initialize. That’s the **Cold Start** time.
- The actual function took 107ms to run.

However I’m still left wondering about:

- How long did the DynamoDB query and the SNS call each take?
- If an API request fails, how do I know if it failed at the DynamoDB step or the SNS step?

To do this we need to enable X-Ray tracing for the services that were invoked by Lambda.

### Enable X-Ray tracing for other AWS services invoked by AWS Lambda

Install the AWS X-Ray SDK. In your project directory, run:

``` bash
$ npm install -s aws-xray-sdk
```

Update your Lambda code and wrap AWS SDK with the X-Ray SDK. Change:

``` javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
```

To:

``` javascript
const AWSXRay = require('aws-xray-sdk-core');
const AWS = AWSXRay.captureAWS(require('aws-sdk'));
```

That’s it!

Now run `serverless deploy` again to deploy the change. This time you can deploy a single function using `serverless deploy -f FUNCTION_NAME`, since we only changed the function code, not our `serverless.yml`.

After you deploy, invoke your API Gateway endpoint again:

``` bash
$ curl https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/xxx
```

Go back to your AWS X-Ray console, wait for the new trace to show up. It might take up to 30 seconds to do so. You can tell if a trace is recent by looking at its **Age**:

![Select recent trace in AWS X-Ray console](/assets/best-practices/tracing-lambda-functions-with-x-ray/click-recent-trace-from-the-aws-x-ray-console.png)

Select the new trace.

![View updated trace in AWS X-Ray console](/assets/best-practices/tracing-lambda-functions-with-x-ray/view-updated-trace-from-the-aws-x-ray-console.png)

This time:

- The Lambda cold start took 461ms, and 185ms to process the request.
- Out of the 185ms, the DynamoDB query took 73ms and the SNS publish call took 98ms.

We can also see clearly the various steps that took place as a part of our Lambda function invocation. Our [sample repo]({{ site.backend_ext_api_github_repo }}) has AWS X-Ray enabled by default so you can play around with the concepts we talked about in this chapter.
