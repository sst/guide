description: To allow users to login using Amazon Cognito in our React.js app, we are going to use AWS Amplify. We need the Cognito User Pool Id and our App Client Id. We login the user by calling the Auth.signIn() method from AWS Amplify.

We are going to use AWS Amplify to login to our Amazon Cognito setup. Let's start by importing it. 

### Import Auth from AWS Amplify

{%change%} Add the Auth module to the header of our Login container in `src/containers/Login.js`.

``` jsx
import { Auth } from "aws-amplify";
```

### Login to Amazon Cognito

The login code itself is relatively simple.

{%change%} Simply replace our placeholder `handleSubmit` method in `src/containers/Login.js` with the following.

``` javascript
async function handleSubmit(event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  try {
    await Auth.signIn(email, password);
    alert("Logged in");
  } catch (e) {
    alert(e.message);
  }
}
```

We are doing two things of note here.

1. We grab the `email` and `password` and call Amplify's `Auth.signIn()` method. This method returns a promise since it will be logging in the user asynchronously.

2. We use the `await` keyword to invoke the `Auth.signIn()` method that returns a promise. And we need to label our `handleSubmit` method as `async`.

Now if you try to login using the `admin@example.com` user (that we created in the [Create a Cognito Test User]({% link _chapters/create-a-cognito-test-user.md %}) chapter), you should see the browser alert that tells you that the login was successful.

Next, we'll take a look at storing the login state in our app.
