Just like [the previous chapter]({% link _chapters/create-a-dynamodb-table-in-sst.md %}), we are going to be using [AWS CDK]({% link _chapters/what-is-aws-cdk.md %}) in our SST app to create an S3 bucket.

We'll be adding to the `StorageStack` that we created.

### Add to the Stack

{%change%} Add the following above the `sst.Table` definition in `stacks/StorageStack.js`.

``` js
// Create an S3 bucket
this.bucket = new sst.Bucket(this, "Uploads");
```

This creates a new S3 bucket using the SST [`Bucket`](https://docs.serverless-stack.com/constructs/Bucket) construct.

Also, find the following line in `stacks/StorageStack.js`.

``` js
// Public reference to the table
table;
```

{%change%} And add the following above it.

``` js
// Public reference to the bucket
bucket;
```

As the comment says, we want to have a public reference to the S3 bucket.

### Deploy the App

If you switch over to your terminal, you'll notice that you are being prompted to redeploy your changes. Go ahead and hit _ENTER_.

Note that, you'll need to have `sst start` running for this to happen. If you had previously stopped it, then running `npx sst start` will deploy your changes again.

You should see that the storage stack has been updated.

``` bash
Stack dev-notes-storage
  Status: deployed
```

### Commit the Changes

{%change%} Let's commit and push our changes to GitHub.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding a storage stack"
$ git push
```

Next, let's create the API for our notes app.
