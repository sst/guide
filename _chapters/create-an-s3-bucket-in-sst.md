We'll be storing the files that's uploaded by our users to an S3 bucket. The template we are using comes with a bucket that we renamed back in the [Create a Hello World API]({% link _chapters/create-a-hello-world-api.md %}).

Recall the following from `infra/storage.ts`.

```ts
// Create an S3 bucket
export const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("Uploads");
```

Here we are creating a new S3 bucket using the SST [`Bucket`]({{ site.ion_url }}/docs/component/aws/bucket){:target="_blank"} component.
