Just like [the previous chapter]({% link _chapters/create-a-dynamodb-table-in-sst.md %}), we are going to be using [AWS CDK]({% link _chapters/what-is-aws-cdk.md %}) in our SST app to create an S3 bucket.

We will be adding to the `StorageStack` that we created.

### Add to the Stack

{%change%} Add the following inside the `StorageStack` function above the `Table` definition in `stacks/StorageStack.ts`.

```typescript
// Create an S3 bucket
const bucket = new Bucket(stack, "Uploads");
```

{%change%} Make sure to import the `Bucket` construct by replacing the import line at the top with the line below.

```typescript
import { Bucket, StackContext, Table } from "sst/constructs";
```

This creates a new S3 bucket using the SST [`Bucket`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/Bucket) construct.

Also, find the following line in `stacks/StorageStack.ts`.

```typescript
return {
  table,
};
```

{%change%} And add the `bucket` above `table` matching the code below.

```typescript
return {
    bucket,
    table,
};
```

This will allow us to reference the S3 bucket in other stacks.

Note, learn more about sharing resources between stacks [here](https://docs.sst.dev/constructs/Stack#sharing-resources-between-stacks){:target="_blank"}.

### Deploy the App

If you switch over to your terminal, you will notice that your changes are being deployed.

Note that, you will need to have `sst dev` running for this to happen. If you had previously stopped it, then running `pnpm sst dev` will deploy your changes again.

You should see that the storage stack has been updated.

```bash
âœ“  Deployed:
   StorageStack
```

### Commit the Changes

{%change%} Let's commit and push our changes to GitHub.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding a storage stack"
$ git push
```

Next, let's create the API for our notes app.
