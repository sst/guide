In case you find yourself having problems with a certain step, we want to make sure that we are around to help you fix it and figure it out. There are a few ways to get help.

- We use [Discourse forum topics]({{ site.forum_url }}) as our comments and we've helped resolve quite a few issues in the past. So make sure to check the comments under each chapter to see if somebody else has run into the same issue as you have.
- Post in the comments for the specific chapter detailing your issue and one of us will respond.

This entire guide is hosted on [GitHub]({{ site.github_repo }}). So if you find an error you can always:

- Open a [new issue]({{ site.github_repo }}/issues/new)
- Or if you've found a typo, edit the page and submit a pull request!
