description: To generate app icons and favicons for our React.js app we will use the Realfavicongenerator.net service. This will replace the default favicon that Create React App comes with.

Create React App generates a simple favicon for our app and places it in `public/favicon.ico` of our app. However, getting the favicon to work on all browsers and mobile platforms requires a little more work. There are quite a few different requirements and dimensions. And this gives us a good opportunity to learn how to include files in the `public/` directory of our app.

For our example, we are going to start with a simple image and generate the various versions from it.

**Right-click to download** the following image. Or head over to this link to download it â€” [{{ '/assets/scratch-icon.png' | absolute_url }}]({{ '/assets/scratch-icon.png' | absolute_url }})

<img alt="App Icon" width="130" height="130" src="/assets/scratch-icon.png" />

To ensure that our icon works for most of our targeted platforms we'll use a service called the [**Favicon Generator**](http://realfavicongenerator.net).

Click **Select your Favicon picture** to upload our icon.

Once you upload your icon, it'll show you a preview of your icon on various platforms. Scroll down the page and hit the **Generate your Favicons and HTML code** button.

This should generate your favicon package and the accompanying code.

{%change%} Click **Favicon package** to download the generated favicons. And copy all the files over to your `public/` directory.

Let's remove the old icons files.

**Note that, moving forward we'll be working exclusively in the `frontend/` directory.**

{%change%} Run the following from our `frontend/` directory.

``` bash
$ rm public/logo192.png public/logo512.png
```

{%change%} Then replace the contents of `public/manifest.json` with the following:

``` json
{
  "short_name": "Scratch",
  "name": "Scratch Note Taking App",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "android-chrome-192x192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "android-chrome-256x256.png",
      "sizes": "256x256",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ],
  "start_url": ".",
  "display": "standalone",
  "theme_color": "#ffffff",
  "background_color": "#ffffff"
}
```

To include a file from the `public/` directory in your HTML, Create React App needs the `%PUBLIC_URL%` prefix.

{%change%} Add this to your `public/index.html`.

``` html
<link
  rel="apple-touch-icon"
  sizes="180x180"
  href="%PUBLIC_URL%/apple-touch-icon.png"
/>
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-32x32.png"
  sizes="32x32"
/>
<link
  rel="icon"
  type="image/png"
  href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon-16x16.png"
  sizes="16x16"
/>
<link
  rel="mask-icon"
  href="%PUBLIC_URL%/safari-pinned-tab.svg"
  color="#5bbad5"
/>
<meta name="description" content="A simple note taking app" />
<meta name="theme-color" content="#ffffff" />
```

{%change%} And **remove** the following lines that reference the original favicon and theme color.

``` html
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="logo192.png" />
<meta
  name="description"
  content="Web site created using create-react-app"
/>
```

Finally head over to your browser and try the `/favicon-32x32.png` path to ensure that the files were added correctly.

Next we are going to look into setting up custom fonts in our app.
