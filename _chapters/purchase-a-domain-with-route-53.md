Our full-stack serverless app is almost ready to go. Currently the API is on an endpoint that's auto-generated by [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

```

While the frontend React app is hosted on an auto-generated [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) domain.

```

We want to host these on our own domain. To do this, we'll start by purchasing a domain through AWS. We'll be using [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) for this.

If you are following this guide but are not ready to purchase a new domain, you can skip this chapter.

On the other hand, if you have an existing domain that is not on AWS, follow these docs to [move it over to Amazon Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/MigratingDNS.html).

Let's get started. In your [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) head over to the Route 53 section in the list of services.

Type in your domain in the **Register domain** section and click **Check**.

After checking its availability, click **Add to cart**.

And hit **Continue** at the bottom of the page.

Fill in your contact details and hit **Continue** once again.

Finally, review your details and confirm the purchase by hitting **Complete Purchase**.

Next, let's use this domain in our serverless app.
