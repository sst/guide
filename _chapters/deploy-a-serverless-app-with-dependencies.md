title: Deploy a Serverless App with Dependencies
description: In this chapter we go over how to locally deploy a serverless app with multiple interdependent services. So you'll need to ensure that you deploy the service that is exporting the reference before deploying the one that imports it. You'll only need to do this for the first time.

So now that we have a couple of downstream services that are referencing a resource deployed in an upstream service; let's look at how this dependency affects the way we deploy our app.

The short version is that:

- When you introduce a new dependency in your app you cannot deploy all the services concurrently.
- However, once these services have been deployed, you can do so.

#### First deployment

In our [resources repo]({{ site.backend_ext_resources_github_repo }}) we are using SST to deploy our CDK app. CDK internally keeps track of the dependencies between stacks.

Our `stacks/index.js` looks like this.

```js
export default function main(app) {
  new DynamoDBStack(app, "dynamodb");

  const s3 = new S3Stack(app, "s3");

  new CognitoStack(app, "cognito", { bucketArn: s3.bucket.bucketArn });
}
```

Here CDK knows that the `CognitoStack` depends on the `S3Stack`. And it needs to wait for the `S3Stack` to complete first.

[SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack) will deploy the stacks in our CDK app concurrently while ensuring that the dependencies are respected.

Next for the [API repo]({{ site.backend_ext_api_github_repo }}) for the first time, you have to:

- Deploy the `notes-api` first. This will export the value `dev-ExtApiGatewayRestApiId` and `dev-ExtApiGatewayRestApiRootResourceId`.
- Then deploy the `billing-api` next. This will export the value `dev-ExtNotePurchasedTopicArn`.
- Then deploy the `notify-job`.

Assuming that you are deploying to the `dev` stage.

If you were to deploy `billing-api` and `notify-job` concurrently, the `notify-job` will fail with the following CloudFormation error:

```txt
notify-job - No export named dev-ExtNotePurchasedTopicArn found.
```

This error is basically saying that the ARN referenced in its `serverless.yml` does not exist. This makes sense because we haven’t created it yet!

#### Subsequent deployments

Once all the services have been successfully deployed, you can deploy them all concurrently. This is because the referenced ARN has already been created.

#### Adding new dependencies

Say you add a new SNS topic in `billing-api` service and you want the `notify-job` service to subscribe to that topic. The first deployment after the change, will again fail if all the services are deployed concurrently. You need to deploy the `billing-api` service first, and then deploy the `notify-job` service.

We are almost ready to deploy our extended notes app. But before we can do that, let's configure our environments.

### Deploying through a CI

If you are using a CI, you'll need to deploy the above in phases. With [Seed](https://seed.run), we handle this using a concept of [Deploy Phases](https://seed.run/docs/configuring-deploy-phases).

### Managing deployment in phases for api

For our api repo, the dependencies look like:

```txt
notes-api > billing-api > notify-job
```

To break it down in detail:

- The `billing-api` service relies on the `notes-api` service for the API Gateway export.
- The `notify-job` service relies on the `billing-api` service for the SNS Topic export.

That covers our section on organizing your serverless app. Next, let's configure our environments.
