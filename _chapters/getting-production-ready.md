Now that we've gone through the basics of creating a full-stack serverless app, you are ready to deploy it to production.

### Deploy to prod

We are now going to deploy our app to prod. You can go ahead and stop the local development environments for SST and React.

{%change%} Run the following **in your project root**.

```bash
$ pnpm sst deploy --stage prod
```

This command will take a few minutes as it'll deploy your app to a completely new environment. Recall that we are deploying to a separate prod environment because we don't want to affect our users while we are actively developing our app. This ensures that we have a separate local dev environment and a separate prod environment.

{%info%}
The `prod` name that we are using is arbitrary. We can call it `production` or `live`. SST just uses the string internally to create a new version of your app.
{%endinfo%}

At the end of the deploy process you should see something like this.

```bash
✓  Deployed:
   StorageStack
   ApiStack
   FrontendStack
   ...
```

### Set secrets in prod

We also need to configure out secrets for production. You'll recall we had previously [configured secrets for our local stage]({% link _chapters/handling-secrets-in-sst.md %}).

We'll do the same here but for `prod`.

{%change%} Run the following **in your project root**.

```bash
$ pnpm sst secrets set --stage prod STRIPE_SECRET_KEY <YOUR STRIPE SECRET TEST KEY>
```

{%note%}
For this guide we are using the same Stripe secret key in production but you'll likely be using different values in production.
{%endnote%}

You can run `pnpm sst secrets list` to see the secrets for the current stage.

Our full-stack serverless app is almost ready to go. You can play around with the prod version.

### Custom domains

However the API is currently on an endpoint that's auto-generated by [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

```

And the frontend React app is hosted on an auto-generated [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) domain.

``` txt

```

We want to host these on our own domain. Let's look at that next.
