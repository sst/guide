title: Parameterize Serverless Resources Names

When deploying multiple environments, some into the same AWS account, some across multiple AWS accounts, we need to ensure the resource names do not thrash across environments. For example, in our `checkout-api` service, we have a Lambda function called `checkout`. Now, if two developers are working on two different features, one deploys to the `featureA` environment and one deploys to the `featureB` environment, and both environments reside in the `Dev` AWS account, only one environment can be successfully deployed. The second environment will get an error indicating that a Lambda function with the name `checkout` already exists.

AWS resources need to be uniquely named within a scope, and the scope is different for different resource types. Here are the rules for some of the commonly used serverless resources:

- Unique per account per region: Lambda functions, API Gateway projects, SNS Topic, etc.
- Unique per account (across all regions): IAM users/roles
- Unique globally: S3 buckets

The best practice to ensure uniqueness is by parameterizing resource names with the name of the stage. In our example, we can name the Lambda function `checkout-featureA` for the `featureA` stage; `checkout-featureB` for the `featureB` stage; and `checkout-dev` for the `dev` stage.

Luckily, Serverless Framework already parameterizes a few of the default resources:

| Resource              | Scheme                                          | Example                                                        |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lambda functions      | `$serviceName-$stage-$functionName`             | notes-app-ext-notes-api-dev-get                                |
| API Gateway project   | `$stage-$serviceName`                           | dev-notes-app-ext-notes-api                                    |
| CloudWatch log groups | `/aws/lambda/$serviceName-$stage-$functionName` | /aws/lambda/notes-app-ext-notes-api-dev-get                    |
| IAM roles             | `$serviceName-$stage-$region-lambdaRole`        | notes-app-ext-notes-api-dev-us-east-1-lambdaRole               |
| S3 bucket             | `$stackName-$resourceName-$hash`                | notes-app-ext-notes-api-serverlessdeploymentbuck-19fhidl3prw0m |

A couple of things to note here:

- Resource names are parameterized with `$serviceName` to ensure resource names do not thrash when deploying multiple services
- The IAM role is the one used by the Lambda functions. IAM role names are also parameterized with `$region` since the name needs to be unique across regions in an account.
- S3 bucket is the one used by Serverless Framework to store deployment artifacts. It is not given a name. In these cases, CloudFormation will automatically assign a unique name for it based on the name of the current stack â€” `$stackName`.

For all the other resources we define in our `serverless.yml`, we are responsible for parameterizing them.

Here are a couple of examples where we need to be aware of resource names being parameterized.

### SNS topic names in `billing-api` service

```yml
resources:
  Resources:
    NotePurchasedTopic:
      Type: AWS::SNS::Topic
      Properties:
        TopicName: ${self:custom.stage}-note-purchased
```

### Parameterize Resources in CDK With SST

For CDK on the other hand we use [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack) to automatically parameterize our stack names. And use a helper method to parameterize specific resource names.

So for example in the `stacks/index.js` file in our [resources repo]({{ site.backend_ext_resources_github_repo }}).

```js
export default function main(app) {
  new DynamoDBStack(app, "dynamodb");

  const s3 = new S3Stack(app, "s3");

  new CognitoStack(app, "cognito", { bucketArn: s3.bucket.bucketArn });
}
```

Our stack names are called `dynamodb`, `s3`, and `cognito`. But when these are deployed, they are deployed as:

```bash
dev-notes-ext-infra-dynamodb
dev-notes-ext-infra-s3
dev-notes-ext-infra-cognito
```

Where `dev` is the stage we are deploying to and `notes-ext-infra` is the name of our SST app, as specified in our `sst.json`.

For specific resources, such as CloudFormation exports, we use the `app.logicalPrefixedName` helper method. Here's an example from `stacks/DynamoDBStack.js`.

```js
new CfnOutput(this, "TableName", {
  value: table.tableName,
  exportName: app.logicalPrefixedName("ExtTableName"),
});
```

The `app.logicalPrefixedName` prefixes our export name with the name of the stage and the app.

Parameterizing your resources allows your app to be deployed to multiple environments without naming conflicts. Next, let's deploy our app!
