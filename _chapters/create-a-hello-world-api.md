With our newly created SST app, we are ready to deploy a simple _Hello World_ API. Let's rename some of the files from our template.

### Rename the Template

{%change%} Replace our `infra/api.ts` with the following.

```ts
import { bucket } from "./storage";

export const api = new sst.aws.ApiGatewayV2("Api");

api.route("GET /", {
  link: [bucket],
  handler: "packages/functions/src/api.handler",
});
```

Here we are creating a simple API with one route, `GET /`. When this API is invoked, the function called `handler` in `packages/functions/src/api.ts` will be executed.

We are also _linking_ an S3 Bucket to our API. This allows the functions in our API to access the bucket. We'll be using this bucket later to handle file uploads. For now let's quickly rename it.

{%change%} Replace our `infra/storage.ts` with.

```ts
// Create an S3 bucket
export const bucket = new sst.aws.Bucket("Uploads");
```

Also let's rename how this bucket is accessed in our app code. We'll go into detail about this in the coming chapters.

{%change%} Rename `Resource.MyBucket.name` line in `packages/functions/src/api.ts`.

```ts
body: `${Example.hello()} Linked to ${Resource.Uploads.name}.`,
```

Given that we've renamed a few components, let's also make the change in our config.

{%change%} Replace the `run` function in `sst.config.ts`.

```ts
async run() {
  await import("./infra/storage");
  await import("./infra/api");
},
```

{%note%}
By default SST sets you up with a TypeScript project. While the infrastructure is in TypeScript, you are free to use regular JavaScript in your application code.
{%endnote%}

Let's go ahead and deploy this.

### Start Your Dev Environment

We'll do this by starting up our local development environment. SST's dev environment runs your functions [Live]({{ site.ion_url }}/docs/live){:target="_blank"}. It allows you to work on your serverless apps live.

{%change%} Start your dev environment.

```bash
$ npx sst dev
```

Running `sst dev` will take a minute or two to deploy your app and bootstrap your account for SST.

```txt
SST 0.1.17  ready!

âžœ  App:        notes
   Stage:      jayair
   Console:    https://console.sst.dev/local/notes/jayair

   ...

+  Complete
   Api: https://5bv7x0iuga.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

The `Api` is the API we just created. Let's test our endpoint. If you open the endpoint URL in your browser, you should see _Hello World!_ being printed out.

You'll notice its also printing out the name of the bucket that it's linked to.

### Deploying to Prod

To deploy our API to prod, we'll need to stop our local development environment and run the following.

```bash
$ npx sst deploy --stage production
```

We don't have to do this right now. We'll be doing it later once we are done working on our app.

The idea here is that we are able to work on separate environments. So when we are working in our personal stage (`jayair`), it doesn't break the API for our users in `production`. The environment (or stage) names in this case are just strings and have no special significance. We could've called them `development` and `prod` instead.

We are however creating completely new apps when we deploy to a different environment. This is another advantage of the SST workflow. The infrastructure as code idea makes it easy to replicate to new environments. And the pay per use model of serverless means that we are not charged for these new environments unless we actually use them.

### Commit the Changes

As we work through the guide we'll save our changes.

{%change%} Commit what we have and push our changes to GitHub.

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push
```

Now we are ready to create the backend for our notes app.
