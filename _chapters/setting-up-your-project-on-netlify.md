Now we are going to host our React app on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). For reference, here's our React app in a GitHub repo.

[**{{ site.frontend_github_repo }}**]({{ site.frontend_github_repo }})

Recall that our React app is a single page app. Where the routes in the app are handled by our client side JavaScript code. We have a single `index.html` at the root of our app that handles all the routes. So we need to tell our hosting provider (in this case Netlify), to redirect any other requests back to this `index.html` file.

### Add a Redirects File

{%change%} Create a file called `_redirects` in the `public/` directory of your React app with the following.

``` text
/*    /index.html   200
```

This is basically saying that any requests should be sent to the `index.html` of our React app.

Note that this file doesn't have an extension. It is just called `_redirects`.

And we are now ready to host our app on Netlify!

### Create a Netlify Account

Start by [creating a free account](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

Next, create a new site by hitting the **New site from Git** button.

Pick **GitHub** as your provider.

Then pick your project from the list.

The default settings are exactly what we want for our React app. Hit **Deploy site**.

This should be deploying our app. Once it is done, click on the deployment.

And you should see your app in action!

Just like that, our app is live! You can share it with your friends and the rest of the world!

By default, a site hosted on Netlify uses their domains. But we want to host our notes app on our own domain. Let's do that next!
