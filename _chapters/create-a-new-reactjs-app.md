---

We are now ready to work on our frontend. So far we've built and deployed our backend API and infrastructure. We are now going to build a web app that connects to our backend.

We are going to create a single page app using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/). We'll use the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) project to set everything up.

### Create a New React App

{%change%} Run the following command **in the `packages/` directory**.

```bash
$ pnpm create vite frontend --template react-ts
```

This will create your new project in the `frontend/` directory.

{%change%} Now install the dependencies.

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ pnpm install
```

This should take a second to run.

### Loading SST Environment Variables

We also want to load the environment variables from our backend. To do this, we’ll be using the [`sst bind`](https://docs.sst.dev/packages/sst#sst-bind) CLI. It'll find the environment variables from our SST app and load it while starting the React development environment. We'll set these environment variables below.

{%change%} Run the following **in the `packages/frontend/` directory**.

```bash
$ pnpm add --save-dev sst
```

To use the CLI, we'll add it to our `package.json` scripts.

{%change%} Replace the `dev` script in your `packages/frontend/package.json`.

```typescript
"dev": "vite",
```

{%change%} With.

```typescript
"dev": "sst bind vite",
```

### Add the React App to SST

We are going to be deploying our React app to AWS. To do that we'll be using the SST [`StaticSite`]({{ site.docs_url }}/constructs/StaticSite){:target="_blank"} construct.

{%change%} Create a new file in `stacks/FrontendStack.ts` and add the following.

```typescript
import { StackContext, StaticSite, use } from "sst/constructs";
import { ApiStack } from "./ApiStack";
import { AuthStack } from "./AuthStack";
import { StorageStack } from "./StorageStack";

export function FrontendStack({ stack, app }: StackContext) {
  const { api } = use(ApiStack);
  const { auth } = use(AuthStack);
  const { bucket } = use(StorageStack);

  // Define our React app
  const site = new StaticSite(stack, "ReactSite", {
    path: "packages/frontend",
    buildCommand: "pnpm run build",
    buildOutput: "dist",
    // Pass in our environment variables
    environment: {
      VITE_API_URL: api.url,
      VITE_REGION: app.region,
      VITE_BUCKET: bucket.bucketName,
      VITE_USER_POOL_ID: auth.userPoolId,
      VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID: auth.userPoolClientId,
      VITE_IDENTITY_POOL_ID: auth.cognitoIdentityPoolId || "",
    },
  });

  // Show the url in the output
  stack.addOutputs({
    SiteUrl: site.url,
  });
}
```

We are creating a new stack in SST. We could've used one of the existing stacks but this allows us to show how to connect stacks together.

We are doing a couple of things of note here:

1. We are pointing our `StaticSite` construct to the `packages/frontend/` directory where our React app is.
2. We are passing in the outputs from our other stacks as [environment variables in Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables){:target="_blank"}. This means that we won't have to hard code them in our React app. The `VITE_*` prefix is a convention Vite uses to say that we want to access these in our frontend code.
3. And finally, we are outputting out the URL of our React app.

### Adding to the app

Let's add this new stack to the rest of our app.

Open `sst.config.ts` and add the following.

{%change%} Replace the `stacks` function with:

```typescript
stacks(app) {
  app
    .stack(StorageStack)
    .stack(ApiStack)
    .stack(AuthStack)
    .stack(FrontendStack);
},
```

{%change%} And add the following import.

```typescript
import { FrontendStack } from "./stacks/FrontendStack";
```

### Deploy Our Changes

If you switch over to your terminal, you will notice that your changes are being deployed.

{%caution%}
You’ll need to have `sst dev` running for this to happen. If you had previously stopped it, then running `pnpm sst dev` will deploy your changes again.
{%endcaution%}

```bash
✓  Deployed:
   ...
   FrontendStack
```

### Start the React App

Let’s start our React development environment.

{%change%} In the `packages/frontend/` directory run.

```bash
$ pnpm run dev
```

This should show where your frontend is running locally.

```bash
  VITE v4.4.9  ready in 227 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://127.0.0.1:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h to show help
```

{%info%}
SST doesn't deploy your frontend while you are working locally. This is because most frontends come with their own local dev environments.
{%endinfo%}

If you head to that URL in your browser you should see.

### Change the Title

Let's quickly change the title of our note taking app.

{%change%} Open up `packages/frontend/index.html` and edit the `title` tag to the following:

```html
<title>Scratch - A simple note taking app</title>
```

Now we are ready to build our frontend! We are going to start by creating our app icon and updating the favicons.
