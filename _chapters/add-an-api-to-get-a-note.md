description: In this chapter we are adding an API to get a note. It'll trigger a Lambda function when we hit the API and get the requested note from our DynamoDB table.

Now that we [created a note]({% link _chapters/add-an-api-to-create-a-note.md %}) and saved it to our database, let's add an API to retrieve a note given its id.

### Add the Function

{%change%} Create a new file in `packages/functions/src/get.ts` in your project root with the following:

```ts
import { Table } from "sst/node/table";
import handler from "@notes/core/handler";
import dynamoDb from "@notes/core/dynamodb";

export const main = handler(async (event) => {
  const params = {
    TableName: Table.Notes.tableName,
    // 'Key' defines the partition key and sort key of the item to be retrieved
    Key: {
      userId: "123", // The id of the author
      noteId: event.pathParameters.id, // The id of the note from the path
    },
  };

  const result = await dynamoDb.get(params);
  if (!result.Item) {
    throw new Error("Item not found.");
  }

  // Return the retrieved item
  return result.Item;
});
```

This follows exactly the same structure as our previous `create.ts` function. The major difference here is that we are doing a `dynamoDb.get(params)` to get a note object given the `userId` (still hardcoded) and `noteId` that's passed in through the request.

### Add the route

Let's add a new route for the get note API.

{%change%} Add the following below the `POST /notes` route in `stacks/ApiStack.ts`.

```ts
"GET /notes/{id}": "packages/functions/src/get.main",
```

### Deploy our changes

If you switch over to your terminal, you'll notice that your changes are being deployed.

Note that, you'll need to have `sst dev` running for this to happen. If you had previously stopped it, then running `npx sst dev` will deploy your changes again.

You should see that the API stack is being updated.

```bash
✓  Deployed:
   StorageStack
   ApiStack
   ApiEndpoint: https://5bv7x0iuga.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Test the API

Let's test the get notes API. In the [previous chapter]({% link _chapters/add-an-api-to-get-a-note.md %}) we tested our create note API. It should've returned the new note's id as the `noteId`.

Head back to the **API** tab in the [SST Console]({{ site.console_url }}) and select the `/notes/{id}` API. You might have to refresh your console.

{%change%} Set the `noteId` as the **id** and click **Send**.

You should see the note being returned in the response.

Next, let’s create an API to list all the notes a user has.
