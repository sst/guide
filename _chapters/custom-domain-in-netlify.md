description: To configure your React app with custom domains on Netlify and AWS, you need to point the Route 53 DNS to Netlify. Create a new Record set, add an A Record, and a CNAME for your new Netlify project.

Now that we [have our React app hosted on Netlify]({% link _chapters/setting-up-your-project-on-netlify.md %}), let's configure a custom domain.

Before we get started, make sure to follow this chapter to [purchase a domain on Amazon Route 53]({% link _chapters/purchase-a-domain-with-route-53.md %}).

### Pick a Netlify Site Name

From the project page in Netlify, hit **Site settings**.

Under **Site information** hit **Change site name**.

The site names are global, so pick a unique one. In our case we are using `serverless-stack-2-client`. And hit **Save**.

This means that our Netlify site URL is now going to be `https://serverless-stack-2-client.netlify.com`. Make a note of this as we will use this later in this chapter.

### Domain Settings in Netlify

Next hit **Domain management** from the side panel.

And hit **Add custom domain**.

Type in the name of our domain, for example it might be `demo-serverless-stack.com`. And hit **Save**.

This will ask you to verify that you are the owner of this domain and to add it. Click **Yes, add domain**.

Next hit **Check DNS configuration**.

This will show you the instructions for setting up your domain through Route 53.

### DNS Settings in Route 53

To do this we need to head back to the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). and search for Route 53 as the service.

![Select Route 53 service screenshot](/assets/select-route-53-service.png)

Click on **Hosted zones**.

![Select Route 53 hosted zones screenshot](/assets/part2/select-route-53-hosted-zones.png)

And select the domain we want to configure.

Here click on **Create Record Set**.

![Create first Route 53 record set screenshot](/assets/part2/create-first-route-53-record-set.png)

Select **Type** as **A - IPv4 address** and set the **Value** to **104.198.14.52**. And hit **Create**. We get this IP from the [Netlify docs on adding custom domains](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/).

![Add A record screenshot](/assets/part2/add-a-record.png)

Next hit **Create Record Set** again.

Set **Name** to `www`, **Type** to **CNAME - Canonical name**, and the value to the Netlify site name as we noted above. In our case it is `https://serverless-stack-2-client.netlify.com`. Hit **Create**.

![Add CNAME record screenshot](/assets/part2/add-cname-record.png)

And give the DNS around 30 minutes to update.

### Configure SSL

Back in Netlify, hit **HTTPS** in the side panel. And it should say that it is waiting for the DNS to propagate.

![Waiting on DNS propagation screenshot](/assets/part2/waiting-on-dns-propagation.png)

Once that is complete, Netlify will automatically provision your SSL certificate using Let's Encrypt.

![Provisioning Let's Encrypt Certificate screenshot](/assets/part2/provisioning-lets-encrypt-certificate.png)

Wait a few seconds for the certificate to be provisioned.

Now if you head over to your browser and go to your custom domain, your notes app should be up and running!

Now our React.js app is hosted on Netlify with a custom domain! Next, let's look at how to use Netlify as a CI/CD pipeline for our React app.
