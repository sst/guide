description: We will use the Seed console to configure our API Gateway endpoints in our serverless project with custom domains. To configure a stage with a custom domain go to the stage settings, select the Route 53 domain, a sub-domain, and the base path.

Our serverless API uses API Gateway and it gives us some auto-generated endpoints. We would like to configure them to use a scheme like `api.my-domain.com` or something similar. This can take a few different steps through the AWS Console, but it is pretty straightforward to configure through [Seed](https://seed.run).

We are using the same custom domain that we purchased back in the [Purchase a Domain with Route 53]({% link _chapters/purchase-a-domain-with-route-53.md %}) chapter.

### Add Custom Domain on Seed

Head over to our app settings in Seed.

Here click on **Edit Custom Domains**.

And click **Add** for our production endpoint.

Seed will pull up any domains you have configured in [Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/).

Hit **Select a domain** and you should see a list of all your Route 53 domains. Select the one you intend to use. And fill in the sub-domain and base path. For example, you could use `api.my-domain.com/prod`; where `api` is the sub-domain and `prod` is the base path.

And hit **Add Custom Domain**.

Seed will now go through and configure the domain for this API Gateway endpoint, create the SSL certificate and attach it to the domain. This process can take up to 40 mins.

While we wait, we can do the same for our `dev` endpoint. Select the domain, sub-domain, and base path. In our case we'll use something like `api.my-domain.com/dev`.

Hit **Add Custom Domain** and wait for the changes to take place.

Now that we've automated our deployments, letâ€™s do a quick test to see what will happen if we make a mistake and push some faulty code to production.
