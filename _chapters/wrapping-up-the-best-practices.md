Congratulations on completing this best practices section of the guide!

You should now have a working real-world Serverless app with:

1. Resources exported and shared between services
2. A single API endpoint shared between services
3. With multiple environments configured across AWS accounts
4. Resource names parameterized with the environment names
5. Deployed in phases to the environments
6. Secrets stored in SSM
7. Tracing enabled in AWS X-Ray

And you should've stepped through the development workflow that we recommended!

The above setup and workflow is exactly what we, and a number of other companies are using in production. We hope that this gives you a good starting point for your projects!
