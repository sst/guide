Now, we are ready to make our first deployment. You can either Git push a new change to master to trigger it.

Letâ€™s do it through Git.

{%change%} Go to your project root and run the following.

```bash
$ npm version patch
```

This is simply updating the npm version for your project. It is a good way to keep track of the changes you are making to your project. And it also creates a quick Git commit for us.

{%change%} Push the change using.

```bash
$ git push
```

Now if you head into the **prod** stage in Seed, you should see a build in progress. To check out the build logs, you can click the **v1** link.

Here you'll see the build taking place live. Click on the **notes** service that is being deployed.

Notice the tests are being run as a part of the build.

Once the build is complete, you'll notice all the stack outputs at the bottom.

To give it a quick test, sign up for a new account and create a note. You can also test updating and removing a note. And also test out the billing page.

**Congrats! Your app is now live!**

Let's wrap things up next.
