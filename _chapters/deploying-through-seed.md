Now, we are almost ready to make our first deployment. Our app also contains a React app in the `frontend/` directory. We need to make sure to run an `npm install` in that directory.

Let's quickly add a build script to do that.

{%change%} Create a new file in your project root called `seed.yml` with.

``` yml
before_build:
  - cd frontend && npm install
```

{%change%} And let's commit and push this change.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding a seed build spec"
$ git push
```

Now if you head into the **prod** stage in Seed, you should see a build in progress. To check out the build logs, you can click the **v1** link.

Here you'll see the build taking place live. Click on the **notes** service that is being deployed.

You'll see the build logs for the in progress build here.

Notice the tests are being run as a part of the build.

Once the build is complete, you'll notice all the stack outputs at the bottom.

### Test Our App in Production

Let's check out our app in production.

To give it a quick test, sign up for a new account and create a note.

You can also test updating and removing a note. And also test out the billing page.

So we are almost ready to wrap things up. But before we do, we want to cover one final really important topic; how to monitor and debug errors when your app is live.
