description: In this chapter we are adding an API to delete a given note. It'll trigger a Lambda function when we hit the API and delete the note from our DynamoDB table.

Finally, we are going to create an API that allows a user to delete a given note.

### Add the Function

{%change%} Create a new file in `src/delete.js` and paste the following.

``` javascript
import handler from "./util/handler";
import dynamoDb from "./util/dynamodb";

export const main = handler(async (event) => {
  const params = {
    TableName: process.env.TABLE_NAME,
    // 'Key' defines the partition key and sort key of the item to be removed
    Key: {
      userId: "123", // The id of the author
      noteId: event.pathParameters.id, // The id of the note from the path
    },
  };

  await dynamoDb.delete(params);

  return { status: true };
});
```

This makes a DynamoDB `delete` call with the `userId` & `noteId` key to delete the note. We are still hard coding the `userId` for now.

### Add the Route

Let's add a new route for the delete note API.

{%change%} Add the following below the `PUT /notes{id}` route in `stacks/ApiStack.js`.

``` js
"DELETE /notes/{id}": "src/delete.main",
```

### Deploy Our Changes

If you switch over to your terminal, you'll notice that you are being prompted to redeploy your changes. Go ahead and hit _ENTER_.

Note that, you'll need to have `sst start` running for this to happen. If you had previously stopped it, then running `npx sst start` will deploy your changes again.

You should see that the API stack is being updated.

``` bash
Stack dev-notes-api
  Status: deployed
  Outputs:
    ApiEndpoint: https://5bv7x0iuga.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
```

### Test the API

Let's test the delete note API.

In a [previous chapter]({% link _chapters/add-an-api-to-get-a-note.md %}) we tested our create note API. It should've returned the new note's id as the `noteId`.

In the **API** tab of the [SST Console]({{ site.console_url }}), select the `DELETE /notes/{id}` API.

{%change%} Set the `noteId` as the **id** and click **Send**.

You should see the note being deleted in the response.

And the note should be removed from the DynamoDB Table as well.

### Commit the Changes

{%change%} Let's commit and push our changes to GitHub.

``` bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Adding the API"
$ git push
```

So our API is publicly available, this means that anybody can access it and create notes. And it’s always connecting to the `123` user id. Let’s fix these next by handling users and authentication.
