Congratulations on completing the guide!

### App in Prod

We've covered how to build and deploy our backend serverless API and our frontend serverless app. And not only does it work well on the desktop.

It's mobile optimized as well!

### Manage in Prod

One final thing! You can also manage your app in production with the [SST Console]({{ site.docs_url }}/console ).

Run the following in your project root.

```bash
$ npm run console -- --stage prod
```

This'll allow you to connect your SST Console to your prod stage.

```txt
SST Console: https://console.serverless-stack.com/notes/prod/stacks
```

It'll show you all the resources in production.

All your users.

The notes your users have created.

You can even see the request logs in production.
