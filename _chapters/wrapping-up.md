Congratulations on completing the guide!

We've covered how to build and deploy our backend serverless API and our frontend serverless app. And not only does it work well on the desktop.

It's mobile optimized as well!

We hope what you've learned here can be adapted to fit the use case you have in mind. We are going to be covering a few other topics in the future while we keep this guide up to date.

If you are looking to use serverless at your company and are wondering how best to structure a large serverless project, make sure to check out our [best practices section]({% link _chapters/best-practices-for-building-serverless-apps.md %}). The entire workflow and the ideas covered are in production at a number of companies.
