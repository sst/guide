Congratulations on completing the guide!

### App in Prod

We've covered how to build and deploy our backend serverless API and our frontend serverless app. And not only does it work well on the desktop.

It's mobile optimized as well!

### Manage in Prod

One final thing! You can also manage your app in production with the [SST Console]({{ site.console_url }}).

Head over to â€” [**console.sst.dev**]({{ site.console_url }}) and sign up for a free account.

You'll need to create a new workspace and connect to your AWS account. Once connected, you'll see all your SST apps and the resources in them.

And you can view the logs for your functions and debug any issues.

[Read more about it over on our docs]({{ site.docs_url }}/console ).
