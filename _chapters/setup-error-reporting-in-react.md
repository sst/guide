Let's start by setting up error reporting in React. To do so, we'll be using [Sentry](https://sentry.io). Sentry is a great service for reporting and debugging errors. And it comes with a very generous free tier.

In this chapter we'll sign up for a free Sentry account and configure it in our React app. And in the coming chapters we'll be reporting the various frontend errors to it.

Let's get started.

### Create a Sentry Account

Head over to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) and hit **Get Started**.

Then enter your info and hit **Create Your Account**.

Next hit **Create project**.

For the type of project, select **React**.

Give your project a name.

And that's it. Scroll down and copy the `Sentry.init` line.

### Install Sentry

{%change%} Now head over to the React `frontend/` directory and install Sentry.

```bash
$ npm install @sentry/browser --save
```

We are going to be using Sentry across our app. So it makes sense to keep all the Sentry related code in one place.

{%change%} Add the following to the top of your `src/lib/errorLib.js`.

```js
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import config from "../config";

const isLocal = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

export function initSentry() {
  if (isLocal) {
    return;
  }

  Sentry.init({ dsn: config.SENTRY_DSN });
}

export function logError(error, errorInfo = null) {
  if (isLocal) {
    return;
  }

  Sentry.withScope((scope) => {
    errorInfo && scope.setExtras(errorInfo);
    Sentry.captureException(error);
  });
}
```

{%change%} Add the `SENTRY_DSN` below the `const config = {` line in `src/config.js`.

```js
SENTRY_DSN: "https://your-dsn-id-here@sentry.io/123456",
```

Make sure to replace `https://your-dsn-id-here@sentry.io/123456` with the line we copied from the Sentry dashboard above.

We are using the `isLocal` flag to conditionally enable Sentry because we don't want to report errors when we are developing locally. Even though we all know that we _rarely_ ever make mistakes while developingâ€¦

The `logError` method is what we are going to call when we want to report an error to Sentry. It takes:

- An Error object in `error`.
- And, an object with key-value pairs of additional info in `errorInfo`.

Next, let's initialize our app with Sentry.

{%change%} Add the following to the end of the imports in `src/index.js`.

```js
import { initSentry } from "./lib/errorLib";

initSentry();
```

Now we are ready to start reporting errors in our React app! Let's start with the API errors.
