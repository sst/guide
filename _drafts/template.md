The content of a chapter goes here. Section titles are formatted as so:

### Section Title

When adding a screenshot make sure to use a descriptive filename and alt-text. For example, here we use the alt-text to describe what this screenshot is about and the filename is just the [Kebab Case](http://wiki.c2.com/?KebabCase) version of that.

### Code Snippets

To ask a reader to add (or remove) a certain code snippet from their project, use the following format.

<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />Add the following snippet to your project.

``` js
console.log('Hello World');
```

Here `<img class="code-marker" src="/assets/s.png" />` adds a visual indication that this code snippet needs to be acted on.

This helps us distinguish them from code snippets that don't need any action. Examples of these would include lines that you simply want the reader to examine or understand.

The code markers helps ensure that readers don't miss any steps.
